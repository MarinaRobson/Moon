We adopted Maxwell from the Harbor Animal Shelter in San Pedro, LA in August 2015.

We were quickly impressed by Max's familiarity with elevators, jumping ability, and snuggliness. Roughly, we estimate that he can clear 2.5 feet! He definitely jumps higher when food is present, but even general excitement will inspire some air-time.

He's very handsome after a proper haircut! 

Max is looking forward to a yard in Charlottesville and possibly a new friend after we get settled.
